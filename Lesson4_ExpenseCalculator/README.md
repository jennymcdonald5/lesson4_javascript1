### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Client-side programming are programs that are written in a separate language. 
   They are embedded in the HTML code and have tags that allow it to identify the program component.
   Users are able to input information to be processed as well.
2. Java and JavaScript are two different programming languages.
   With JavaScript, programs are interpreted within the browser.
   With Java, programs are compiled and then are run on their own without other applications.
3. There are multiple ways that JavaScript can be included in HTML programs. 
   The first way is to embed the JavaScript code tag in the HTML code (<script>...</script>).
   The second way is to embed the JavaScript code into a separate external file (<script src="name_of_program.js"></script>)
